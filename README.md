# Summarization-tool

A graphical application built with Python's Tkinter for summarizing text using extractive and abstractive techniques. The extractive summarization is achieved using TF-IDF and cosine similarity, while the abstractive summarization leverages Hugging Faceâ€™s T5 model for generating coherent summaries.

**Features**
Extractive Summarization: Identifies key sentences from the input text based on relevance using TF-IDF.
Abstractive Summarization: Produces a natural language summary using Hugging Face's T5 model.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple GUI with options to toggle between Dark and Light modes, making it easy for users to work in different lighting environments.
Custom Icons: Incorporates PNG icons and logos for a visually enhanced interface.

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.7+
**Required Libraries:**
tkinter (comes with Python)
transformers
nltk
scikit-learn
